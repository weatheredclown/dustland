# Dev Tools & Infrastructure

*By Priya "Gizmo" Sharma*

Engineering-facing plans that keep the toolkit lean and moddable:

- `editor.md` – goals for the built-in world editor.
- `wizard-framework.md` – guided creation workflow for complex content.
- `module-json-tools.md` – import/export pipeline for module data.
- `procedural-map-generator.md` – seeded map creation pipeline.
- `tech-debt-paydown.md` – roadmap for cleaning up core engine code.
