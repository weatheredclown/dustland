# Editor Notes
*By Priya "Gizmo" Sharma*

Our editor should feel like a trusty pocket multitool. Drop-down menus for modules, drag-and-drop for NPC placement, and instant validationâ€” no one should fight the tools. Every asset lives in a predictable folder, and the editor warns instead of crashing when someone forgets a comma. Let's keep the UI keyboard-friendly and expose hooks so modders can extend panels without forking the core.
