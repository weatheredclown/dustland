# DOS/VGA Adventure Inspirations

*Author: Riley "Clown" Morgan*

Drawing from the era when 320x200 screens ruled, Dustland CRT can channel early '90s DOS/VGA adventures like **Space Quest IV**, **Beneath a Steel Sky**, and **Flashback**:

- Sardonic sci-fi comedy and meta puzzles keep the wasteland playful.
- Moody industrial skylines and class drama anchor its dystopian vibe.
- Rotoscoped-style cutaways hint at fluid action without heavy assets.
- Chunky panels and 256-color palettes nudge the UI toward VGA nostalgia.
- Snappy verb-driven interactions stay menu-friendly and accessible.

These beats let the neon carnival tip its hat to classic adventures while staying lean and hackable.
