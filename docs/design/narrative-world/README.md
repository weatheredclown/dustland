# Narrative & World

*By Alex "Echo" Johnson*

Story-first documents that set tone, characters, and module content:

- `plot-draft.md` – caravan campaign outline and tasks.
- `true-dust.md` – opening module layout and quests.
- `persona-mechanics.md` – identity-swapping masks and quests.
- `pit-bas-module.md` – plan for porting the PIT.BAS adventure.
- `dos-vga-inspiration.md` – tonal touchstones from classic adventures.
