# Gameplay Loop
*By Mateo "Wing" Alvarez*

Feel every encounter in your pulse. Combat should reward timing and positioningâ€” dodge at the last frame, strike where it hurts, then sprint before the dust settles. I want mobs that telegraph clearly and punish greed, plus arenas with multiple routes for stylish escapes. Playtest with a stopwatch: if a fight drags past ninety seconds, trim the fat. Players chase mastery, so surface stats and replays to fuel that drive.
