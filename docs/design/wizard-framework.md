# Wizard Framework
*By Alex "Architect" Chen*

Let's build a system that builds systems. Our wizard framework should be the go-to tool for content creators, turning complex tasks into a guided, step-by-step process. Whether it's an NPC who needs a rare item or a building with a dozen interconnected rooms, the wizard handles the heavy lifting.

The core principle is simplicity. Each wizard is just a small configuration file defining the steps, the prompts, and the data to collect. The framework reads this config and generates the UI, validates the input, and outputs a clean, game-ready data structure. No scripting, no boilerplate. Adding a new wizard should be as simple as writing a recipe, not coding a new application. This frees up our creators to focus on what matters: building a world full of life and adventure.
