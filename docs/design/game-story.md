# Game Story
*By Alex "Echo" Johnson*

The Dustland stretches beyond the horizon, a patchwork of forgotten highways and half-buried towns. Survivors cling to myths about a signal that can stitch the world back together. Our party rides into this mess not as heroes, but as witnesses. Every quest should show how people bend— or break— under the weight of dust and hope. Give me moments where a broken radio triggers an uprising, or a cracked photo frame becomes a plot twist. Keep the tone soulful, never cynical; we scrape the rust to find glimmers underneath.
