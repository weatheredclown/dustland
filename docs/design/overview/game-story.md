# Game Story
*By Alex "Echo" Johnson*

The Dustland stretches beyond the horizon, a patchwork of forgotten highways and half-buried towns. Survivors cling to myths about a signal that can stitch the world back together. Our party rides into this mess not as heroes, but as witnesses. Every quest should show how people bend— or break— under the weight of dust and hope. Give me moments where a broken radio triggers an uprising, or a cracked photo frame becomes a plot twist. Keep the tone soulful, never cynical; we scrape the rust to find glimmers underneath. Sardonic sci-fi jabs and the occasional meta puzzle keep the wasteland playful in a Space Quest IV kind of way.

Reality here sits in a barrel-shaped pocket dimension. Relics slide in from Earth's timeline starting in the 1950s, and the further a thing has traveled into tomorrow, the more shattered it lands. Transistor radios arrive almost whole; smartphones are glittering dust. The people who've been stranded here patch these scraps with mid-century know-how and stubborn hope. They've lived in the Dustland so long their memories of Earth smear like fog on glass.
