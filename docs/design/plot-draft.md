# Plot Tasks
*By Alex "Echo" Johnson*

This checklist charts the caravan's chase after a fading broadcast. We'll cross off each beat as the signal sharpens.

## Plot
- [x] Outline the caravan's pursuit of the fading broadcast across the Dustland.
  - The caravan catches the ghost of a broadcast near the Salt Flats and tracks its fading pulses by night.
  - Ruined rail towns and dead malls scatter false echoes, but the crew rigs antennas and readings to keep the trail alive.
  - A final shiver of sound draws them to a collapsed observatory where the signal sinks beneath the horizon, promising deeper secrets.
- [ ] Decide whether restoring the broadcast heals the wastes or silences their stories.
- [ ] **Gizmo:** Keep broadcast fragments modular so new episodes slot in without rewiring tools.
- [ ] **Wing:** Pace each stop with a ticking clock or rival crew so the caravan never stalls.
- [ ] **Clown:** Paint each stop like a glitchy midway to keep the signal trail feeling like a rogue carnival ride.

## Characters and Arcs
- [ ] Detail Mara "Surveyor"—an ex-cartographer seeking the map she burned; arc: learns the signal isn't the only way home.
- [ ] Detail Jax "Patch"—a scavenger mechanic hoarding tech; arc: opens his toolkit to the crew.
- [ ] Detail Nyx "Speaker"—a poet tuning radio static into verse; arc: chooses between broadcasting or listening.
- [ ] **Gizmo:** Flag each character's gear for editor hooks so we can test their arcs in isolation.
- [ ] **Wing:** Give every arc a signature encounter that teaches their move set under fire.
- [ ] **Clown:** Sketch alt personas and mask options; doppelgänger vibes fuel fan quests and cosplay.

## Items
- [ ] Flesh out the Signal Compass that spins toward the next fragment of the broadcast.
- [ ] Flesh out the Glinting Key that opens an echo chamber hidden beneath the highway.
- [ ] Flesh out the Memory Tape that captures choices to replay for other survivors.
- [ ] **Gizmo:** Call out any custom UI needs for these items to keep the pipeline tidy.
- [ ] **Wing:** Note upgrade paths or cooldowns so players can route runs around them.
- [ ] **Clown:** Make sprites kitbash-friendly so modders can remix them into neon charms.

## Puzzles
- [ ] Design a radio tower alignment puzzle that tunes the broadcast.
- [ ] Design a dust storm navigation puzzle using wind chimes along ruined billboards.
- [ ] Design a layered graffiti decoding puzzle to reveal a safe route before the sun bleeds out.
- [ ] **Gizmo:** Build puzzles from reusable widgets—modders will thank us.
- [ ] **Wing:** Allow quick resets and split timers so practice runs feel fair and fast.
- [ ] **Clown:** Drop in hooks for glitch filters; let the wasteland melt into art when players reroute.

## Team Review
- **Gizmo:** Modular breakdown checks out, though tagging task dependencies would keep the toolchain humming.
- **Wing:** Detail level feels right; add rough time boxes so the caravan never idles.
- **Clown:** Forethought's strong—save a flex slot in each list for carnival surprises.
