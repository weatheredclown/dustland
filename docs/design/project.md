# Project Overview

*By Riley "Clown" Morgan*

We're building a hackable, no-build playground—a wasteland stitched with Planescape oddities and Nethack grit. The editor sits alongside the world, letting anyone pop the hood and rewrite reality mid-run.

Every sprite and script is a mask waiting to be swapped. Players can spawn doppelgängers, twist tiles with arcane macros, and weave secret identities through the ruins. If you can imagine it, you can code it, no compile ceremony required.

The goal is a living toolkit: part game, part open sketchbook. We keep the rules lean, the files plain, and the door wide open for mods, forks, and mischief.
