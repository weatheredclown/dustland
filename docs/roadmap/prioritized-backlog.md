# Prioritized Roadmap Review

*By Dustland CRT Team*

## Team Debrief

- **Clown (Riley):** "Too many side-show specs. Let’s chase the sparks that actually light up the wasteland."
- **Echo (Alex):** "Our caravan needs a spine—clear arcs, bold beats. The rest is garnish."
- **Gizmo (Priya):** "The engine’s coughing. If we don’t clean the pipes, every new gadget we bolt on will rattle loose."
- **Wing (Mateo):** "Combat’s still a tech demo. Until adrenaline and flow land, none of the other features matter."

## Prioritized Roadmap

1. **Combat overhaul** – core loop still unbuilt; adrenaline-based system defines game feel.
2. **RPG progression** – instant level-ups and trainer flow tie directly into combat and pacing.
3. **Tech-debt paydown** – namespace and event bus cleanup unblock future work.
4. **True Dust starter module** – anchors early narrative and quest flow.
5. **Hydration system polish** – vital survival mechanic lacks UI and item hooks.
6. **Bunker fast travel** – quality-of-life upgrade pending map answers.
7. **Oasis trader refresh** – economy needs persistence before more vendors.
8. **Spoils caches** – flavorful loot but secondary to core systems.
9. **Persona mechanics** – identity swaps can wait until arcs are playable.
10. **Wizard framework** – creator tooling valuable long-term, lower priority now.
11. **Multiplayer prototype** – ambitious scope; defer until single-player stabilizes.

*Dynamic Weather is complete and lives in `docs/design/completed/dynamic-weather.md`.*

## Corrective Actions

1. **Quarterly Roadmap Reset** – triage all design docs against player value and drop low-impact work.
2. **Living Backlog Board** – track features by impact/effort instead of document status.
3. **Gatekeeper Sessions** – pitch problems before writing full design docs.
4. **Doc Retirement Policy** – close or consolidate drafts with no champion for two cycles.
5. **Narrative Milestone Reviews** – keep story-driven features like True Dust aligned with core gameplay.
