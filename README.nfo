[ ABOUT ]
  Dustland CRT is a single-file HTML/JS prototype with a crunchy CRT vibe,
  branching dialog, party stats, inventory, quests, and a world+hall demo.
  It’s built to be easy to run and easy to hack.

[ HOW TO RUN ]
  - Just open:  index.html  (double-click or serve from any static server).
  - No build step. No dependencies. Works offline.
  - Tip: Use a modern Chromium, Firefox, or Safari.

[ CONTROLS ]
  Movement .......... WASD / Arrow Keys
  Interact .......... E / Space  (talk, doors, take nearby item)
  Take Item ......... T          (take from your tile or adjacent tiles)
  Inventory ......... I
  Party ............. P          (radio button selects the acting member)
  Quests ............ Q
  Save / Load ....... G / L      (or UI buttons)
  Minimap ........... M
  Close Dialog ...... Esc

[ KEY MECHANICS ]
  - You cannot stand on NPCs (!) or items; they block movement.
  - Picking up: stand next to or on your tile and press E/Space or T.
  - The selected party member (radio in Party tab) makes skill rolls and
    receives XP for dialog checks and quest rewards.
  - World buildings appear as black structures; their doors lead to
    simple interiors you can enter directly from the overworld.
  - Water is bright blue and is not walkable; items won’t spawn in water.

[ CHARACTER CREATION ]
  - Start a new game at boot if no save is present.
  - Create 1–3 drifters (funny quirks, specializations, secret origins).
  - You’re NOT forced to fill all three slots—“Start Now” begins immediately.
  - You can also hit “Load Game” directly from creator.

[ SAVE DATA ]
  - Saved to localStorage under key: dustland_crt
  - “Reset” clears party/inventory and returns you to Creator.
  - To fully wipe: clear the site’s localStorage from your browser.

[ PROJECT LAYOUT ]
  - Single file:  index.html
    * Styles (CRT curvature/ghosting), Canvas renderer, Game state, Creator,
      Dialog system, Quests, Inventory + Equipment, Save/Load, Test Hall,
      simple World gen.
  - No external assets or libraries.

[ KNOWN GOOD BEHAVIOR (v0.6.7) ]
  - Stable boot: hall always renders before any modal (no blank canvas).
  - Items/NPCs draw before player (no sprite pop-under).
  - Loot from chests spawns on a nearby free tile (never under the player).
  - World building doors lead to interiors; hall top door exits to world.
  - “Selected” party member determines rolls & takes XP.

[ TROUBLESHOOTING ]
  - Black screen on load?
      * Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R).
      * Check console for errors.
      * If a corrupted save exists, click “Reset” or clear localStorage.
  - Can’t pick up items?
      * Press E/Space or T while standing next to (or on) the item tile.
  - Rolls/XP going to the wrong member?
      * Open Party tab and switch the Selected radio—this member becomes
        the leader for checks and XP.

[ HACKING NOTES ]
  - Everything is at the bottom of the HTML inside a self-invoking function.
  - Useful entry points:
      * genHall(), genWorld(), seedWorldDropsAndNPCs()
      * makeNPC(), NPCS[], quests{}, itemDrops[]
      * renderParty(), renderInv(), renderQuests()
      * takeNearestItem(), interact(), move()
  - Tiles: see TILE enum + colors[] + walkable[].
